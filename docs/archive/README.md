# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documents that are no longer actively used but preserved for historical reference.

## Why Archive?

Documents are archived when they:
- Contain time-specific information that has passed (e.g., 3-month roadmaps)
- Describe tasks or plans that have been completed
- Are superseded by newer, more comprehensive documentation
- May contain useful historical context for future reference
